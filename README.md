# Just-Dice
Dice Rolling Application

This is a very simple applicaiton to roll the dice and get random values for each.

I started this in on online class I took provided by the London App Brewery.  The course was taught by Angela Yu.  She made it clear that these apps could be used to buid up our portfolio and even change an publish to the app store.

So, my intention is to add a fair amount of value to the app from what I did in class using learning I gained in and out of the class and publish to the app store.  I realize it is a very simple app, it does have value.  Development to testing, to submision, to enhancements and maintenance.

I use the current iOS development environment including xCode 10, iOS 12 and Swift 4.0.
