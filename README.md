# Just-Dice
Dice Rolling Application

This is a very simple applicaiton to roll the dice and get random values for each.

So, my intention is to add a fair amount of value and publish to the app store.  I realize it is a very simple app, but it doesis handy for someone who wants to place a dice game but does not have any or just wants to use their phone instead. 

I use the current iOS development environment including Xcode 10, iOS 12 and Swift 4.0.
